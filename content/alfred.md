# ALFRED :  Alignment Free Distance Estimator
AlFRED is an Alignment Free Distance Estimator software. Currently, it
provides the following options :

1. Compute k-mismatch longest common substring using the prefix-chopping
   algorithm for a pair of sequneces.
2. Compute k-mistmatch average common substring for every pair of
   strings present in a database of strings.

# Installation

## Dependencies
### External Dependencies that need to be installed
* A modern, C++11 ready compiler such as `g++` version 4.8 or higher or `clang` version 3.2 or higher.
* The [cmake](www.cmake.org) build system (Version >= 2.8.11).
* A 64-bit operating system. Either Mac OS X or Linux are currently supported.
* Git version control system

### Dependices made available with the gz file
* [googletest](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) is included as git submodule.
* [libdivsufsort](https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort) libraries are copied in the directory.

## Compilation

Download the tar.gz file available [here](assets/docs/alfred.tar.gz). Extract the
contents as follows:

    tar xvzf alfred.tar.gz

Next, create a build directory. For example,

     mkdir build
     cd build

Finally, configure build the executable 'alfred.x'. Continuing the example,

     cmake ..
     make


# Usage

## Preparing Input

Place the input sequences into a single fasta files. Make sure that the
header of the fasta file has the appropriate sequence name and also that
the output file has one of fasta or fa or fas extension.  Note that the
program accepts only sequences with valid DNA or protien alphabets.  An
example is as shown below.

    >SeqName
    ACGTTAGAGTAAATGGAGTAGAAT

## Compute k-mismatch Average common substrings for a string database
Run the program while providing this input file as -f option, the output
file as the -o option, and the number of mismatches to allow is given as
-k option. An example is shown below:

    build/alfred.x -f primates.full.fas -o acs.primates.k3.out -k 3

Output is generated in a matrix format, which can be fed directly to PHYLIP

## Compute k-mismatch LCP between two sequences
Run the program in the same manner shown above, add the -p option to stop after generating the k-mismatch LCP values. An example is shown below:

    build/alfred.x -f primates.full.fas -o acs.primates.k3.out -k 3 -p

Output is generated in json format. json ouput has two arrays -- one for
each string. Each array L is of the length of the string, where i-th
entry of L has both index and length of longest common substring for the suffix starting at i.
